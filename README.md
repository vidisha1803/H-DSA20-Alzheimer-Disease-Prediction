Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Tool

This project is a web-based application designed to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's Disease using brain CT scan images. The app leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and provides users with detailed predictions, confidence scores, and information about the disease.

Features

- Upload CT Scans: Users can upload brain CT scan images in PNG, JPG, or JPEG formats.
  
- Disease Prediction: The model classifies the image into one of five categories:
  - AD: Alzheimer's Disease
  - CN: Cognitively Normal
  - EMCI: Early Mild Cognitive Impairment
  - LMCI: Late Mild Cognitive Impairment
  - MCI: Mild Cognitive Impairment
- Confidence Scores: The app provides a percentage confidence score for the prediction.

- Disease Information: Users receive basic information about the predicted disease stage and can perform a Google search for further details.
